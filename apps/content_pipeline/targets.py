"""Company targets for the scraper engine.

Each entry maps a company key to its public presence on every channel the
engine supports — social, owned content, SEC filings, and news coverage. Add new companies here — no engine changes needed.

Targets saved from the frontend's "Save as Target" button live in
custom_targets.json instead (see save() below) and are merged in below,
so they resolve the same way as anything hand-written here.
