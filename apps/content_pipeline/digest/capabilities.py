"""Reference table of our own offerings, practice areas, and case studies.

Fed into the digest LLM prompts (company digests only) so a channel summary
can map a detected theme — a named vendor, technology, or infrastructure
initiative — to one of our own offerings, instead of stopping at a generic
"reach out" angle. This is what lets a highlight like "Northern Trust
engages Lukka for digital-asset reporting" become "pitch API integration
of Lukka onto our ALTRO platform" rather than just a linked headline.

PLACEHOLDER CONTENT. Every description below needs to be replaced with the
real offering/case-study detail before a digest generated with this context
is sent to an account. Nothing here should be treated as fact by the LLM
beyond "this offering exists and covers these domains" — keep descriptions
short and factual once filled in, not marketing copy, since the model will
quote them back nearly verbatim in a sales pitch.
