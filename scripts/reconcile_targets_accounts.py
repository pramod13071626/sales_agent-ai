"""Reconciliation check: apps/content_pipeline's `targets` table vs this
app's `accounts` table.

MERGE_PLAN.md (S7.3) splits ownership by responsibility instead of merging
the two lists: `accounts` is the registry of which companies exist at all;
`targets` is content-pipeline-specific scrape config (LinkedIn URL, SEC CIK,
etc.) for a subset of them. The two live in genuinely separate databases
today (see Phase 1) and nothing enforces the "every targets.key needs a
matching accounts.key" rule automatically, so this is a manual check to run
periodically rather than a live constraint.

Reports two kinds of drift:
  - orphaned target config: a targets.key with no matching accounts.key
    (scrape config for a company sales_agent-ai doesn't know about)
  - unmonitored accounts: an accounts.key with no targets entry (a company
    that's trackable in sales_agent-ai but has no content monitoring set up)

Usage: python scripts/reconcile_targets_accounts.py
Reads TARGETS_DATABASE_URL / ACCOUNTS_DATABASE_URL from the environment,
falling back to sensible local-dev defaults for each app (matching
apps/content_pipeline/config.py's DATABASE_URL_NEON default and this app's
own DATABASE_URL) if unset — override either when checking a different
pair of databases.
